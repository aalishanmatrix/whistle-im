Internationalization
--------------------
For now we have translated the app and the website from English, which is the default language
used in the sources, to German. You can find all current translations in `i18n/LANGUAGECODE.json`.
Pull requests, even for entire languages, are welcome!

In case you intend to extend whistle.im with your native language, please review our [Contributor
License Agreement](https://github.com/whistle-im/whistle-im/blob/master/CLA) (CLA) before you start.

Translations are simple JSON files containing mappings of English words and sentences to your native
language. Some values use placeholders like `%name%` which must not be translated but kept as is.
These will later be replaced with the actual information that belongs there. Some values also use
HTML tags like `<strong>` or similar. These must not be changed in any way but kept as is. Language
files must use UTF8 encoding and be valid JSON.

To create a new language, just fork our repository, add your language file and send us a pull
request. If you do not know how to do this, you can also send us your translation by email. We
will take care of it then.

Whenever you are contributing (to) a language, please state that you have read and agreed to our
CLA mentioned above.

Thank you!
